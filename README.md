# Algorithm Implementation
This repo collects some of my algorithm or data structure implementation written in Python. They serve as an exercise for algorithm design and data structure. Examples of implemented algorithm:

### Data Structure
1. Binary Search Tree
2. Heap (Min./ Max.)
3. Union Find

### Sorting
1. Quick Sort
2. Inversion

### Graph
1. Depth First Search
2. Breath First Search
3. Dijkstra Shortest Path
4. Prim's Algorithm
5. Random Contraction

### Greedy
1. Clustering
2. Scheduling Problem
3. Huffman Coding

### Dynamic Programming
1. Johnson's Algorithm
2. Optimal Binary Search Tree
3. Knapsack Problem
4. Weighted Independent Set
